### more defined idea for this course

Mobile application for android where you can read bar codes from groceries. Bar code reader is using CameraX API for using decive camera and ML kit API for recognizing barcodes from live feed.

From the barcode rawdata application fill fetch data for basic diet information like carps, proteion and fat. For this app is using FatSecret Platform API.

#### Links to API:s

### Ideas to continue

Mobile application can be used as a food diery. From fetched diet info user can add servings to his/her food diery.

Since FatSecret don't have most of the bar codes for products originated from Finland, there sould be a way to find ingredients adnd product by name to complite user's opportunity to add those to the food diery.
